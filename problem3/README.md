# Problem 3

### Printing Quotes

- Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author.

### Constraints

- Use a single output statement to produce the output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
- Do not use string interpolation or substitution if the chosen language supports it. Use concatenation instead.
