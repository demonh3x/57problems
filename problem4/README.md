# Problem 4

### Mad Lib

- Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

### Constraints

- Use a single output statement.
- If your chosen language supports it, use string interpolation or string substitution to build up the output.
